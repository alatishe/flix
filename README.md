# Two create-react-apps

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The even-nos folder is for the function that will return the sum of all the even values. While the flix-api folder retrieves a list of films from
an API endpoint and render them to the UI.
